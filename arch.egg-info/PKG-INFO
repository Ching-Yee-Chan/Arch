# ARCH: Audio Representations benCHmark

ARCH is a benchmark for audio representations. Its goal is to provide an unified framework for the evaluation of audio representations.
The benchmark is intended to be **easy to use** and to **allow the comparison of different audio representations**.

The main features of ARCH are:
- **Easy to use**: the benchmark is designed to be easy to use.
- **Comprehensive evaluation**: the benchmark provides a comprehensive evaluation of audio representations. It aims at providing a unified framework for the evaluation of audio representations on a wide range of tasks.
- **Standardization**: the benchmark wants to standardize the evaluation of audio representations. The pletora of ARL models and datasets makes it difficult to compare them. The benchmark aims at providing a standard way to evaluate audio representations.
